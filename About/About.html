<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;font-weight: bold;">Why Finance</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">When I came to DePaul University, I was only certain of one thing, that I would pursue a major within the school of business. I started with Accounting and I went on to declare every other major at one point in time during my first two years at DePaul. However, my final stop was Finance. I chose it because I thought Finance was an overall solid major that would allow me to exit into anything. It was only at the end of my sophomore year that I realized why I truly chose Finance. It was because of the stimulation, the constant changing markets and securities landscape. The technological transformations and the adapting rules and everything in between captivated me. There was so much to learn, and I have never been as eager to learn as I am now.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;font-weight: bold;">Why This Website</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">I created this website as a place to share my knowledge and experiences. I do not have social media as I am not a fan of it, so I created my own. I also see this as an opportunity to improve my HTML skills as I design and integrate new code to support my objectives. My goal will be to create research papers, informative articles and opinions pieces and use this website as a place of storage for everything that I create. I will not, however, promote or market this website. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;font-weight: bold;">Education</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">I am currently in my third year at DePaul University, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Finance with an expected graduation date of June 2022. I have taken courses in Finance, Accounting and Economics. More specifically, I have taken basic level Finance, Accounting and Econ as well as Intermediate Finance. I am also a part of the Keeley Academy, a two-year competitive co-curricular program for high potential Finance majors pursing banking, capital markets and investment management careers.   </p>

<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">My first job that I started back in Sophomore year of high school in 2016. I worked my way up from phone boy to assistant store manager. It was my first work experience working for someone, my first work experience taking on responsibility and my first work experience making money. I learned how to use the phones and progressed to eventually learn how to run the entire store. I left in 2019.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">VelocityEHS:</p>

VelocityEHS is a leading Environmental, Health and Safety software company that provides service to over 20k customers. This is where I currently work as an Accounting Intern. I was brought on with two other interns and now I am the only one that remains. The job started with basic office tasks and developed to more challenging projects and assignments. Now, I work directly with the Accounts Receivable team assisting them with collections. I am involved in tax collections, auditing, and assisting management in various other projects. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">Delta Sigma Pi – Vice President of Finance</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">I joined the professional fraternity Delta Sigma Pi at DePaul my freshman year. It was this organization that introduced me to my closest friends, gave me opportunities I could not have imagined and shared memories like no other. I got so much out of it that I felt it was an obligation of mine to give back. So, I ran and got elected as the VP of Finance. This entailed the responsibility of collecting dues, approving expenses, and managing budgets. But I wanted more, so I created an Investment Committee and recruited individuals within the chapter that were interested and had experience in the investing world. Together we created a portfolio for the fraternity to grow our financials and allow us the opportunity to create more opportunities and experiences in the future for all brothers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">CFA Research Challenge – Captain of DePaul Team</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">The CFA Research Challenge is a global annual stock competition that is headed by James Valentine at DePaul University. I am the captain of one of the two teams and my responsibility is to ensure we are all working collectively to win the local, regional, and national levels to qualify for the global finals. This activity will end in February/March depending on how we perform but it occupies 5-10 hours of time a week and it is something I am very passionate about. I want to win, and I am willing to do anything to prove that DePaul is a top tier school. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">Vincentian Service Scholarship Cohort</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">I was accepted into the scholarship cohort for my sophomore year at DePaul and I am on my second year of the cohort now. This cohort challenged and helped me discover who I am. We invested time in community service, community speaker events, and a weeklong service immersion trip to Philadelphia. I have learned the virtues of compassion, gratitude, respect and giving to the less fortunate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">Habitat for Humanity</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">This was the first club I joined at DePaul and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I made some amazing friends, and we went on a weeklong service trip to New Orleans to help build homes for underprivileged individuals. I used to participate in monthly home builds and Habitat Restore services and I cannot wait to go back once COVID allows us to. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">DePaul University Fishing Club</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">In high school, I joined a fishing club where I got addicted to fishing. I ended up qualifying for the National Championship in 2018 by placing 2nd place in the Illinois State Championship. I closed out my high school career with a Top 50 finish in the US. But since DePaul University did not have a fishing club, I decided to create one with my friends. Since its creation we have had over 50 members, gone on 2 major fishing trips, and competed in one tournament. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px; text-decoration: underline;">Other interests</p>
<p style="margin-left: 750px;margin-right: 750px;">I also enjoy working out at 5:30 am every morning, learning new cooking recipes, traveling on the weekends, trading/investing in various securities, reading books, and most importantly spending time with my family and my closest friends.</p>
