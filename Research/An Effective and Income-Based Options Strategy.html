     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">Before I begin, I wanted to take the time to note something. This paper is intended for an audience that understands the following material and terminology: options, stocks, fundamental and technical analysis, and general trading/investing terminology. I also want to point out that the reason I am sharing with you my strategy and its success is because I want to inform and educate. I do not believe this strategy can be replicated to the point that it no longer works and that is what makes this strategy that much more wonderful. Time to begin!</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">In February of this year, I was clueless, because that was when I started trading options. I had no prior knowledge to derivatives whatsoever. I understood stock trading and had two brokerage accounts, but I never dived into the options market until then. Fast forward 10 months later and it is a completely different story. Over these months I have learned more about the markets than ever before. I learned to be patient, emotionless, vigilant, and not afraid to take risks. In this process, I discovered a strategy that I will share with you that promises safety and consistent income with minimal management. </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">Through the start of COVID to now, I have buried myself in books, online courses, certifications and so on. But this strategy was built on the ideas of a book, I just applied those ideas to a different security: stock options. The book is called The Complete Guide to Options Selling by James Cordier and Michael Gross. It is a book dedicated to this underappreciated yet highly criticized (for the wrong reasons) options strategy: selling option contracts. Selling contracts is seen as “absurd”, “insanely risky”, “unlimited losses” and so on. The book, however, digests this topic and gets to the truth; that risks can be managed, profits can be consistent, and alpha can be significant. However, the authors apply and recommend this strategy be used with options in the commodities markets. Well, after doing some research and extensive back testing I was able to apply the concepts effectively to stock options.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">The main principle that is taught in the book is that by using this strategy you are not trying to predict where the market will go but where it will NOT go. By being an options BUYER, you must be correct both in the direction and the time of the option contract. By being an options SELLER, neither of these apply to you. You make money as time decays the options premium and you can make money if the market goes up, down or sideways so long as the option expires worthless. Guess what? 80% of all options expire worthless. I would much rather take the probability of winning 80% of the time than losing 80% of the time. </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">However, you might be wondering, what are these “unlimited risks” that people talk about? Well, when you sell an option contract you must buy it back at the future. If it goes against you, you might have to buy it back at a loss. And selling a naked option means that you potentially have an unlimited loss. But do not worry because there are simple risk management rules that I have developed to prevent this from ever happening. First, always sell vertical spreads (credit spreads). A vertical spread is when you sell the higher premium contract and buy the lower premium, resulting in a credit spread. Your max profit is the difference between the premium prices, and your max loss is the total width of the two strikes minus the max profit. I do not even have the capital or options level to be able to sell naked positions, so I have always stuck to verticals. The second management rule is the “Rule of 200” and the “Rule of 10”. The Rule of 200 means that if your loss ever doubles your max profit, just exit the trade because it is not worth it. As an example, if I sold a vertical and collected $64 per contract, I would exit if the position went sharply against me and I was down $128. The Rule of 10 means that if at any point during the life of the trade only 10% of profits remain, exit the trade because most of the time it is not worth holding and taking the risk that the trade reverses on you. These two risk measurements have prevented me any max losses or any reversals that reduced my profits. </p>

     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">There are two more parts that round out this strategy. One of which is the use of fundamental analysis to provide additional support for your positions. Understanding the stock and the critical factors that move the stock up and down is a key advantage. If you fundamentally analyze a company and understand how the business works you can make a general assumption. That assumption is whether this company is stable now, in terms of earning power and stock price volatility, and if it will continue to be stable into the future. The trader must determine their trading horizon; one month? 3? A year? I will not tell you or teach you fundamental analysis, that is for your own good, but I can tell you this. Analyze a company, determine if your research suggests the company is going to be trading in an up or down trend and figure out how long this trend will last. Once you have these details, sell a vertical put if you are bullish and sell a vertical call if you are bearish and watch time decay do its thing. </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">The other part is the use of technical analysis. This type of analysis is phenomenal for determining solid entry points into your positions. Again, I am not going to teach this. But, if you understand how to read technical charts and you can spot certain patterns, resistance and support lines, trends and consolidations then you have an advantage. My favorite use of technical charts is using support and resistance levels as fair entry points into either a bullish or bearish position. The closer the stock price gets to my determined level, the higher my max profit is because it is getting closer to my ideal strike price (the stock price that I believe the stock will never trade at). It is even possible to make short-term trades using technical analysis as the primary basis of the strategy and still maintain high profitability. </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">Finally, time to put it all together. The strategy is built on the idea of selling options at a price that we believe a particular stock will never reach. The basis of this belief is built on our personal fundamental research and analysis. And we determine entry points by using technical analysis. Let us take look at an example. Let us pretend that we fundamentally researched McDonalds and have determined that at its current trading price of $215 as of 12/18/2020 there is no way that McDonalds would drop to $180 three months from now. While taking a glance at MCD’s charts, you realize that there is a strong support at $206 that MCD’s has not traded at in the last four months. You take your time and wait for MCD’s to retrace a little bit. A few days later MCD’s opens lower at $208, you take this opportunity and sell a vertical put 90 days from that day at a strike of $180. You collect $50 of premium and have a max loss of $450. Your exit points are set at a loss of $100 or the remaining profit being $5. You now wait patiently; you check the stock once or maybe twice a day and let time decay do its thing. Ideally, if your analysis was correct, MCD’s $180 puts expire worthless in 90 days and you keep your premium. Or even better, MCD’s skyrockets to $240 and your option is worthless, so you exit early to take your profits. Just keep in mind that exiting a vertical spread will cost you commissions, just like entering will. So be aware of your commissions expense to determine if it is worth exiting early or waiting for the contract to expire worthless. </p>

     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">That is all there is to the strategy. If you do your due diligence when it comes to the research, then everything else works in your favor. Now, you might be wondering what my results are? Well, I will not tell you exact P/L but let me just say that my probability of being profitable is greater than 80%. It takes time to develop a strategy but once you do, it can really work in your favor.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;color: blanchedalmond;">blank</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 450px;margin-right: 450px;text-indent: .5in;">To conclude, there are many ways to make money trading various types of securities. I though I would just share this one with you for your own knowledge. Do your own research, back test this strategy, and modify it to make it even be better. It is up to you what you do with this information, but my goal is that you have at least learned something new. Happy trading!</p>
